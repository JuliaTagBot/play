	* testparscore.jl: par-score statistics show 3/4 of hands end up

	N = 717102
	NS = .4994
	EW = .5006
	NS>0 = .7687
	EW<0 = .7682

	* bidfreq.pl: compute bid frequencies based on pbn game records.
	It may help to design system output to have the correct
	frequencies with random weights?

	$ bidfreq.pl `find pbn -name '*.pbn'` > bidfreq.out
